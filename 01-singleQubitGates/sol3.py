# Implement a circuit that applies a Pauli Y gate followed by a Pauli Z gate to a qubit. Measure the qubit and analyze the measurement outcomes.

# Create a quantum circuit with 1 qubit
qc = QuantumCircuit(1, 1)

# Apply a Pauli Y gate to the qubit
qc.y(0)

# Apply a Pauli Z gate to the qubit
qc.z(0)

# Measure the qubit
qc.measure(0, 0)

# Simulate the circuit on a classical computer
simulator = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')

# Get the measurement outcomes

# Analyze the measurement outcomes

# Theoretically, we expect all measurements to be '1' since YZ is equivalent to an X gate,
# which flips |0⟩ to |1⟩ and vice versa.
